Using emoji to write C  📝🇨😂

## Get Started ⚡🏃

Clone the repo to your project directory

We have already made a test code written in emoji-c for this repo

Compile the test code with a C compiler that supports Unicode identifier(eg: clang) 

```bash
clang ./emoji-c/test/testcode.c -o ./test && ./test
```

The test code computes how many ways to combainate given amount(1 ≤ n ≤ 10000) of yuan with Renminbi notes(￥1, ￥5, ￥10, ￥20, ￥50, ￥100)

(Just a simple backpack dynamic programming)
